Hi, I’m Kaniz Fatema Mithun, an aspiring data scientist based in Sydney…..

This subject introduces students to the complexities of human language data and the use of Natural Language
Processing (NLP) and text mining techniques to analyse them. Students develop both technical and communicative
skills to process and interpret unstructured textual data with a range of practical applications. Covering core NLP
concepts and the latest developments in large language models, the course equips students with skills for insightful
pattern discovery in natural language text, while emphasising ethical considerations.
